//! Windows abrupt-owner-death cleanup for the local SSH transport.
//!
//! `ssh::bridge` ends a locally spawned `ssh` child through its owner guard plus a Unix `atexit`
//! hook. Neither covers Windows: there is no portable process-exit hook, and `Drop` is bypassed by
//! `std::process::exit`, by an abort, and by the OS tearing the process down.
//!
//! This module owns the Windows transport spawn for exactly that reason. The child is created with
//! `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST` (a `STARTUPINFOEX` attribute), so it is a member of the private
//! kill-on-close job **at creation**: there is no window in which a child exists outside the job,
//! which is what a `CreateProcess`-then-`AssignProcessToJobObject` sequence cannot promise - an
//! owner that dies inside that window would strand a child that nothing owns. The child is created
//! suspended, membership is verified through the kernel, and only then is it resumed, so a member
//! can never run unsupervised. `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST` needs Windows 10 / Server 2016 or
//! newer, the same floor this application already has.
//!
//! Ownership shape (the reason this module performs the spawn):
//! * [`TransportOwner::prepare`] creates the private, non-inheritable job limited to
//!   `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`;
//! * [`TransportOwner::spawn`] builds the creation attributes for that job and for the exact stdio
//!   handles the child may inherit, creates the child inside the job, verifies membership with
//!   `IsProcessInJob`, resumes its primary thread, and hands back a [`TransportChild`] whose stdio
//!   is already converted to the `tokio::process` stream types the bridge expects;
//! * the job handle is the only handle to the job, so the kernel terminates every member as soon as
//!   it closes: normal drop, `std::process::exit`, panic, or hard process death alike.
//!
//! No process is ever identified by pid for signalling: the child is only ever terminated through
//! the process handle returned by `CreateProcessW` or by closing the job. The module touches no
//! remote PTY, helper, or reconnect state, and the non-Windows transport path is untouched.
//!
//! Tests (Windows only): `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib transport_windows`.
//! `creation_places_the_child_in_the_job_before_it_runs` is the regression test for the creation
//! window: it asserts membership and the still-suspended primary thread before any resume, the
//! owner-death case included. See the protocol notes on `tests`.

/// `FERRYX_TRANSPORT_OWNER_TEST_MODE`) so that the owner's death is a real process event:
///
/// * the parent passes the member's stdin pipe read end to the owner and keeps the write end open
///   and unwritten, so the member's blocking read can never end on its own;
/// * the parent gives the owner a `Stdio::piped` stderr channel, which the owner re-passes to the
///   member as its stdout, so that channel closes only when both writer processes are gone;
/// * the owner announces readiness only after asserting the member is running and inside the job;
/// * the parent then either terminates the owner's process handle with a code of its own, or lets
///   the owner leave through `std::process::exit`, and asserts the owner's exit code pins that
///   cause before awaiting channel EOF as the member's death event.
///
/// The member's exit status is deliberately not evidence at either level: a member terminated
/// because the last handle to a kill-on-close job was closed exits with `STATUS_SUCCESS` (0), the
/// status the kernel's close path passes to its job termination, while `TerminateJobObject` is the
/// API that carries a caller-chosen code. Both levels therefore assert membership, liveness, and
/// the exclusion of every self-driven exit path instead of an exit code.
