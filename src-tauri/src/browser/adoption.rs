//! Adoption acknowledgements for CLI-opened browser sessions.
//!
//! `ferryx browser open` creates a backend session, but only the GUI knows whether that
//! session reached a visible tab: an active remote host, a duplicate `browserId`, or a failed
//! pane adoption all leave the panel hidden. The CLI must be able to say which one happened
//! instead of reporting a tab nobody can see.
//!
//! The GUI answers through [`cmd_browser_session_adoption`], resolving the waiter that the CLI
//! registered with [`expect`] BEFORE it emitted `browser_session_created`. Registration is
//! deliberately first: a fast GUI could otherwise answer before anyone was listening.
